# IOT_Projects 

This repository holds all the projects related to IOT using Raspberry Pi.

| Project Name  | Project Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| iotled  | The objective of this exercise is to integrate Spring Boot and Pi4J to create a simple Web application to make the LED toggle (on or off) based on the REST URL hit on the browser. |
| iotled-mqtt  | The Objective of this exercise is to integrate Spring Boot, Pi4J, MySQL database on to Raspberry Pi by creating a simple Web application to toggle (ON or OFF) the LED on Raspberry Pi based on the REST URL hit on the browser and to persist the LED information (i.e blink status, blink datetimestamp, blink counter, JSON format) to MySQL database. Also we can view the LED information that is persisted in the MySQL database. Also the LED information is published to a topic on MQTT Broker, which can accessed by any MQTT client subscribed for that topic. |
| iot-pi4j-raspicamera  |  The Objective of this exercise is to run the Java program on Raspberry Pi which will take 10 Selfie Snaps and two 10 second Videos. |
| iot-pi4j-raspicamera-QRScanner  | The objective of this post is give overview on how to taka a snap using Camera module and decode the snap for the QR codes using ZXing API’s in Java. |
| iot-pi4j-raspi-relay  | The Objective of this exercise is to configure a Relay Switch with Raspberry Pi and control it with 5V (by switching it ON and OFF) based on trigger from PIR Motion Sensor, which in turn controls the Main Power (220V) and switch on an Electrical bulb. This can be considered as a security system where if the PIR Motion sensor senses any movement, it will automatically switch ON the bulb and alert everyone. |
| iot-pi4j-raspi-steppermotor  | The Objective of this exercise is to configure the Stepper Motor with Raspberry Pi and control it (by rotating the Motor in Forward and Backward direction) using GPIO pins on Raspberry Pi.  |
| iot-pi4j-sensors  | PIR stands for Passive InfraRed. This motion sensor consists of a fresnel lens, a infrared detector and supporting detection circuitry. The lens on the sensor focuses any infrared radiation/wavelengths present around it towards the infrared detector. Our bodies generate infrared heat and as a result this gets picked up by the motion sensor. The sensor outputs a 5V signal for a period of one minute as soon as it detects us. It offers a tentative range of detection of about 6-7 m and is highly sensitive. When the PIR motion sensor detects a person, it outputs a 5V signal to the raspberry pi through its GPIO. And we define what the raspberry pi should do as it detects an intruder through Java Pi4J coding. Here we are just printing: “Intruder detected”. |
| Python_Basics  | The objective of this tutorial is to implement the basic concepts of Python related to IOT   |
| QRCode  | The objective of this post is give overview on how to generate a QR and Bar codes using ZXing API’s in Java. Also it gives an overview on how to decode a QR and Bar code in Java.  |
| Twilio  | The Objective of this exercise is to send an SMS/MMS in Java using Twilio.  |
| Utilities  | The objective of this tutorial is to implement MQTT Publisher sample  |
